# Serverless Workflow Automation

## Overview

This project is focused on building a serverless workflow automation system using AWS Lambda functions and AWS CloudFormation. It enables the automation of tasks such as file processing, data transformation, and alerting using serverless architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Lambda**: AWS Lambda is utilized for running serverless functions in response to events.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) to define and provision AWS resources.
- **Python**: Lambda functions are written in Python.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `lambda_functions/`: Contains Python scripts for Lambda functions.
- `cloudformation_templates/`: Stores CloudFormation templates for infrastructure provisioning.
- `docs/`: Documentation and project-related files.
